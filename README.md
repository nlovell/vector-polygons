<p align="center"> Easily generate coordinates for regular polygons
    <br> 
</p>

Just a little function that takes some parameters, and spits out vertex coordinates for any regular 2d polygons with `n` number of sides. It was a tangent on something else I was working on, and a fun little exercise in TypeScript. I'm also using this minor project to work on documentation and testing tools, so this will likely be overkill.

Feel free to submit an issue or pull request if you want to see anything changed.
